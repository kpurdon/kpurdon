# Hi, I'm Kyle 👋

I'm a Staff Software Engineer with over 15 years of experience building backend systems, developer platforms, and cloud infrastructure. Most of my work has been in Go, with a strong focus on simplicity, scale, and developer experience. Name any cloud technology (platform, database, cache, queue, language, etc.), and I've probably had to deploy it, build on it, or use it at some point.

You'll notice my public contributions here are pretty quiet — that's because the vast majority of my work has been for private companies over the years. I’ve spent most of my career helping startups and growth-stage companies define and grow products, build scalable systems, secure infrastructure, and adopt internal platforms that power product delivery.

### 🛠️ What I do

- Build backend systems and APIs in Go/Python
- Design developer platforms and internal tools
- Architect and deploy infrastructure on GCP, AWS, and Kubernetes
- Lead engineering initiatives from prototypes to production

### 📍 Currently

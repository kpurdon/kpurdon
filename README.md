# Hi, I'm Kyle 👋

I'm a Senior/Staff Software Engineer with over 15 years of experience building backend systems, developer platforms, and cloud infrastructure. Most of my work has been in Go, Python, and Kubernetes, with a strong focus on simplicity, scale, and developer experience.

You'll notice my public contributions here are pretty quiet — that's because the vast majority of my work has been for private companies over the years. I’ve spent most of my career helping startups and growth-stage companies build scalable systems, secure infrastructure, and internal platforms that power product delivery.

### 🛠️ What I do
- Build backend systems and APIs in Go
- Design developer platforms and internal tools
- Architect and deploy infrastructure on GCP, AWS, and Kubernetes
- Lead engineering initiatives from prototypes to production

### 📍 Currently
Exploring new opportunities in backend and platform engineering. If you're building something interesting or want to connect, feel free to reach out!
